                    After months of counting down during the dull, dreary winter season, summer is finally among us. There is something about the summer season that excites people and gets them outside. Summer days are long, carefree, and full of sunshine. When summer winds down and comes to a close, people tend to reflect and think about what they wanted to do during the summer but did not seem to get around. That’s how life goes on
